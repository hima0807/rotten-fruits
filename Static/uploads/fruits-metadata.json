See _fruits-360_dataset_meta_ folder.\n\n-The _multi_ branch, which contains images with multiple fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. These images are not labeled. See _fruits-360_multi_ folder.\n\n-The _3_body_problem_ branch where the Training and Test folders contain different (varieties of) the 3 fruits and vegetables (Apples, Cherries and Tomatoes).

This will help you to make the distinction between the _original-size_ branch and the _100x100_ branch.\n\n### For the _multi_ branch\n\nThe file\u0027s name is the concatenation of the names of the fruits inside that picture.\n\n## Alternate download\n\nThe Fruits-360 dataset can be downloaded from: \n\n**Kaggle** [https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)\n\n**GitHub** [https://github.com/fruits-360](https://github.com/fruits-360)\n\n## How fruits were filmed\n\nFruits and vegetables were planted in the shaft of a low-speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded. \n\nA Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.\n\nBehind the fruits, we placed a white sheet of paper as a background. \n\nHere is a movie showing how the fruits and vegetables are filmed: https://youtu.be/_HFKJ144JuU\n\n### How fruits were extracted from the background \n\nHowever, due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm that extracts the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type:  we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked.\n\nAll marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of the pixels are considered as belonging to the object.\n\nThe maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.\n\nPictures from the test-multiple_fruits folder were taken with a Nexus 5X phone or an iPhone 11.\n\n\n## History ###\n\nFruits were filmed at the dates given below (YYYY.MM.DD):\n\n2017.02.25 - First fruit filmed (Apple golden).\n\n2023.12.30 - Official Github repository is now [https://github.com/fruits-360](https://github.com/fruits-360)\n\n2025.04.21 - Fruits-360-3-body-problem uploaded.\n\n\n## License\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nCopyright (c) 2017-, [Mihai Oltean](https://mihaioltean.github.io)\n\nYou are free to:\n\n*Share* \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n\n*Adapt* \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n\nUnder the following terms:\n\n*Attribution* \u2014 You must give appropriate credit , provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made .
